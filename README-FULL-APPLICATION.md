# Message Parsing Application

This application parses structured plain-text messages containing patient information and extracts relevant data fields. The core functionality focuses on parsing and extracting patient data, and this document outlines how to structure a full application around this core functionality.

### Separation of Concerns

- **Data Access**: Managed by the models directory, where we define data schemas and interact with the database.
- **Business Logic**: Encapsulated in the services directory, where the core functionality, such as message parsing, resides.
- **Presentation**: Handled by the controllers directory, which processes incoming HTTP requests and returns responses.
- **Utilities**: The utils directory contains helper functions and error handling utilities.
- **Configuration**: The config directory holds configuration files such as database connection settings.

### Modularity and Maintainability

- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and delegate tasks to services.
- **Services**: Contain business logic and handle data processing.
- **Models**: Define data structures and manage database interactions.
- **Utilities**: Provide common functionalities such as error handling and logging.

### Error Handling and Logging

- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling is implemented in the `utils/errorHandler.ts` file. This ensures consistent error responses and helps with debugging.
- **Logging**: Use a logging library such as `winston` or `log4js` to log errors, warnings, and informational messages. Logs should be stored in a file and/or a logging service for analysis.

### Scalability and Potential Future Extensions

- **Scalability**: The application is structured to handle additional features and higher loads. For example:
  - **API Layer**: Implemented using a framework like Express.js to handle HTTP requests efficiently.
  - **Database**: Choose a scalable database solution like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or MySQL.
  - **Caching**: Use caching mechanisms like Redis to improve performance for frequent read operations.
  - **Microservices**: Consider breaking down the application into microservices if the project grows significantly, allowing independent scaling and deployment.
- **Future Extensions**: The modular structure allows easy addition of new features. For example:
  - **Additional Parsers**: Support for different message formats can be added by creating new services.
  - **Authentication and Authorization**: Add middleware for secure API access.
  - **User Interface**: Develop a frontend using frameworks like React or Angular to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the API.
